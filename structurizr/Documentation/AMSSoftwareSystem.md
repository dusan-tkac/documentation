# AMS System context

Here is some context about the AMS software system...

AMS is the main system for storing and managing assumptions which are used as inputs for model runs.
It also allows user to manage model versions and specify model run parameters.

AMS creates submissions in Runs Controller - submission being a set of model runs with same inputs and model version with the only difference being a seed number used for random number generators.
