    <h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<h4 id="errors">Errors</h4>
<p>Most AMS and Runs Controller components create log entries using <a href="https://serilog.net/">Serilog</a> and send them to Seq(<a href="https://getseq.net/">https://getseq.net/</a>) instance.</p>
<p>Our Seq instance URL is <a href="http://iorper-webd01:5341/#/dash">http://iorper-webd01:5341/#/dash</a>.</p>
<p>The Seq dashboard provides and overview of logged errors and other important events.</p>

<p>By clicking on a dashboard chart you can navigate to the events screen and see filtered events.</p>

<p>Errors monitoring should be done daily.</p>
<p>Seq also stores other event types, not just errors. These logged events can be invaluable when investigating some issues.</p>
<h4 id="runs-controller-status">Runs Controller status</h4>
<p>Another daily task is to check availability of Runs Controller clients.</p>
<p>Runs Controller Portal Nodes screens lists active, inactive and decommissioned nodes (clients).
If client becomes inactive it usually means there are technical issues on the machine that need to fixed.</p>
<p>Number of threads displayed on the dial in the top-right corner is another useful indicator.</p>
<p>This screen also displays distributor status.</p>

<p>Runs controller distributor and clients still use event log for most of their logging.
In some cases it may help to have a look at logged events when investigating Runs Controller issues.</p>
<h4 id="hangfire-queue">Hangfire Queue</h4>
<p>Hangfire also requires regular monitor.</p>
<p>Occasionally, most often in Test environment, job gets stuck and blocks processing queue.
The stuck job needs to be deleted; sometimes, if the queue has grown too long; the enqueued jobs need to be deleted too.</p>
<p>The Hangfire Windows Service may need a restart.</p>
<p>Recently deleted jobs can then be re-queued.</p>

<h4 id="database-sizes">Database sizes</h4>
<p>All database sizes and their growth should be regularly checked to avoid running out of space.</p>
<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>
<p>Following documents list and explain configuration of AMS and Runs Controller main components (BHP Billiton account required to sign in to SharePoint):</p>

<h4 id="background-processing-in-hangfire-stopped-and-users-were-not-able-to-create-submissions">Background processing in Hangfire stopped and users were not able to create submissions</h4>
<p>In Seq there were errors logged when users tried to create submissions:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusan-tkac/documentation/master/structurizr/Documentation/Screenshots/MessageQueueErrorSeq.png" alt="Message Queue Error in Seq" /></p>
<p><strong>Error text:</strong></p>
<pre><code>ScheduleSubmissionCreationInRunsControllerFailed
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hangfire.BackgroundJobClientException: Background job creation failed. See inner exception for details. ---&gt; System.Messaging.MessageQueueException: Insufficient resources to perform operation. at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.SendInternal
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Route cause:</strong></p>
<p>Hangfire uses MSMQ for creation and scheduling of background jobs.</p>
<p>For production these message queues are configured on IORPER-WEB01.</p>
<p>There are multiple message queues used - all private and originally with journal messages enabled.
Journal messages were not being processed and their number grew to an extent where it prevented further message creation.</p>
<p>When MSMQ windows service was stopped it could not be restarted.
The error (when trying to start the MSMQ service) was:</p>
<pre><code>The Message Queuing service terminated with the following service-specific error: 
%%3222143985
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: This approach removes all unprocessed messages from all queues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on <a href="http://www.mikerodionov.com/2016/02/the-message-queuing-service-terminated-with-service-specific-error-1072823311/">Unable to start Message Queuing service: �The Message Queuing service terminated with service-specific error %%-1072823311�</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Stop MSMQ service.</li>
<li>Delete all files (*.mq and QMLog) from the C:\Windows\System32\msmq\storage folder.</li>
<li>Change registry value \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters\LogDataCreated to 0.</li>
<li>Start MSMQ service.</li>
<li>Disable journal messages for Hangfire queues</li>
</ul>
