    <h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<h4 id="errors">Errors</h4>
<p>Most AMS and Runs Controller components create log entries using <a href="https://serilog.net/">Serilog</a> and send them to Seq(<a href="https://getseq.net/">https://getseq.net/</a>) instance.</p>
<p>Our Seq instance URL is <a href="http://iorper-webd01:5341/#/dash">http://iorper-webd01:5341/#/dash</a>.</p>
<p>The Seq dashboard provides and overview of logged errors and other important events.</p>

<p>By clicking on a dashboard chart you can navigate to the events screen and see filtered events.</p>

<p>Errors monitoring should be done daily.</p>
<p>Seq also stores other event types, not just errors. These logged events can be invaluable when investigating some issues.</p>
<h4 id="runs-controller-status">Runs Controller status</h4>
<p>Another daily task is to check availability of Runs Controller clients.</p>
<p>Runs Controller Portal Nodes screens lists active, inactive and decommissioned nodes (clients).
If client becomes inactive it usually means there are technical issues on the machine that need to fixed.</p>
<p>Number of threads displayed on the dial in the top-right corner is another useful indicator.</p>
<p>This screen also displays distributor status.</p>

<p>Runs controller distributor and clients still use event log for most of their logging.
In some cases it may help to have a look at logged events when investigating Runs Controller issues.</p>
<h4 id="hangfire-queue">Hangfire Queue</h4>
<p>Hangfire also requires regular monitor.</p>
<p>Occasionally, most often in Test environment, job gets stuck and blocks processing queue.
The stuck job needs to be deleted; sometimes, if the queue has grown too long; the enqueued jobs need to be deleted too.</p>
<p>The Hangfire Windows Service may need a restart.</p>
<p>Recently deleted jobs can then be re-queued.</p>

<h4 id="database-sizes">Database sizes</h4>
<p>All database sizes and their growth should be regularly checked to avoid running out of space.</p>
<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>
<p>Following documents list and explain configuration of AMS and Runs Controller main components (BHP Billiton account required to sign in to SharePoint):</p>
